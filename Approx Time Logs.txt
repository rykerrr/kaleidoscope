Generation, 64x64 RT, rounded values

- With regular instancing, tracking by adding to array
Approx 16 seconds generation
Approx 8 seconds clear

- With instanced mesh instancing (sequential, 64x64 times)
Approx 4 seconds generation
Near instant clear

- With instanced mesh instancing (batch)
Approx 4 seconds, seems slightly longer than for sequentially generating them
Near instant clear

- With instanced mesh instancing (batch, separated transform creation and the instancing itself)
Approx 3 seconds to create transforms
Near 1 second to create instances
Near instant clear

Took a good 20+ minutes to generate, around 2-3 seconds to clear, rendering seemed to not have a high impact
